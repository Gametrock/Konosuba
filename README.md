## Vs Konosuba
Well, it should be noted that this is our first full week, so it may not be a super good quality mod (I mean, VS Agoti type) but if we put effort into this mod, I hope you understand.

Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo !, better known for short as KonoSuba !, is a series of Japanese light novels written by Natsume Akatsuki and illustrated by Kurone Mishima.

The songs of this mod come from the same anime, so all those songs belong to the corresponding authors, we did not create those songs.
